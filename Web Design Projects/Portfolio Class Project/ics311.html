			ICS 311, or better known as Database Management System was an amazing class as well. I loved this class. Everything about database just clicked well with me so I throughly enjoyed it. We dealt with building databases, designing ERDS, and even worked on a final project that dealt where we ourselves built a whole database
			ourselves. Overall, it was a really fun class for me. I enjoyed using MYSQL as well
			as working with Java to build a GUI for my database. There were some challenging
			things along the way, but it was great experience nonetheless.
