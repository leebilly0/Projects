			<center><b>CSCI 1082</b></center>
			This was by far my favorite class throughout my academic career! We did so many interesting programs during this time. I programmed a game of random odds where 3 people had to take turns to kill each other; each with their own benefits (if say guy A kills guy B, guy A automatically will kill guy C and so on). I programmed a random lottery generator along with random tickets I purchased to see how many tries it took until I hit the lottery. I created a tic tac toe GUI that I could play tic tac toe on. It was overall a really fun class. I learned so much during this course: classes, encaspulation, more class exception handling, and for the first time I was taught Java. So it was an extremely rewarding experience and eventually painted the way for me to work on further projects with other people (such as a few Adobe Flash projects).
