		My experience with programming begins here. It began with this class at Century College. This was an introductory class to get people familiar with programming. The basics of basics. We are introduced to basic concepts, structures and techniques of programming in C++. One of the most notable projects I worked on during this time involved entering in the correct username and password to access a bank account. Once inside the bank account, you may update info on the account such as withdraw or deposit dollar amounts. Throughout this class we learned different types of loops (do while, while, for loop), learned how to use iterations, basic exception handling, basic manipulation and movement of data (with the use of pointers), and working with switch statements.
