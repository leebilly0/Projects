			This class touched up on Assembly language. That language difficult for me. Although not entirely difficult, the syntax of the way it's written gets to my head. Other than that, this class wasn't too bad itself too. Learned a lot about
			CPUs and other things such as dealing with different styles of binaries. I just
			finished this class this semester as well, but overall I did pretty well in it.
