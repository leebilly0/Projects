			<center><b>Math 1081</b></center>
			I took Math 1081 (Better known as Calculus I) at Century College. Obviously, the main point of Calculus I is all about them derivatives. Unfortunately, I didn't do as well as I had hoped as my final droppe my grade down a bit. However, it was still good enough for me to move on and take the next course, MAth 1082. This class
			was a tough class for me though, mainly because I'd been gone from Math for so long.
			It had been almost 3 years since I've taken a Math class, so I had to work pretty
			hard to get myself all caught up again.
