			ICS 240 or more better known as Elementary Data Structures taught me lots of things about th organization of data. Some of the things we worked on were things
			such as tree nodes (as seen by the image above). Other things we learned in the
			class were things like stacking (image on the bottom left), different methods to
			sort (such as the commander and conquer method, bubble sorting, and so on) as well
			as learning to work with generics.<br/>

			Overall, this class was quite fun. We worked a lot in groups, so a lot of our
			assignments were done in groups. This was so that we had experience working as a
			team as in the work field, this would probably be how things were done. This almost
			helped us make ourselves accountable for our team members as well, as I myself did
			not want to be the guy to left my team down. That's not to say we didn't have
			individual assignments either, but what stood out to me were the team assignments
			we had to do.<br/>
			<br/>
			This class however did no have any quizes or tests, therefore all your grading
			was based on how well you did in your own assignments. This meant that even the
			weight of these assignments meant a lot more too as a whole. So of course, obviously
			extra work had to be put in. We were told to follow certain guidelines as well
			whenever submitting codes and such (such as commenting, cleaning up code and submitting a documented version your methods and such).
			If any of it was off, we were penalized for it.
