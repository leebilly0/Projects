			ICS 232 (Mobile Application Development) was an awesome class. I know I say that a lot, but it really was. Out of all my classes, I felt like this was the most up to date class as far as technology was concern and it was also fun to create your own apps! We did things like create a tip calculator app. We also did things like create a notepad app that store the notes onto either your android phone memory or an sd card. It would then be able to read it back to you if u accessed the app later. <br/>
			<br/>
			I really liked this class although it was extremely though. This eventually led to me working on my own projects in Android as well, which you can see in the projects
			section of my website. Its unfortunate Metro State University discontinued the class
			for now, it was quite rewarding. Although, the class did require a lot of knowledge
			of data structures (although the requirement was only object oriented); that might've
			been why the class was more difficult for other students.
