			Discreate Mathematics. I'm not gonna lie, this was an obviously difficult class for me as it dealt a lot with computer heads. Sometimes, wrapping your head
			around problems can be quite confusing. I'm glad I did well in this course and 
			it has really been beneficial in my upper divison courses I've taken so far
			at Metro State University.
