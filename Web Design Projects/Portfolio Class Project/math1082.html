			It's all about that integration. Math 1082 (or Calculus II) was taken at Century College. Calculus two was an awesome class; I mean, it was basically the exact opposite of exactly what Calculus I basically was. I'm not saying it wasn't easy, 
			but having gone through Calculus I, Calculus II was a lot easier. Having the basic
			fundamental concepts of Calculus I really helped make the transition to Calculus II
			easier. Then again that's how most classes work too right? You gotta have the basics
			of any class down before you take a more difficult class anyways.
