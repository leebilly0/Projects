			Currently I am finishing up this class right now. In fact, this whole website right here is because of this class. This portfolio website if you will. To be honest too, I don't think I would've been able to do this whole website if not for this class. I basically didn't know very much, but this class helped me at least get
			a better understanding of what web designing was really like. I still have much to learn, and so much more to do. I have a buddy who's been doing this since he was in high school and is amazing at this. I hope to one day be even close to as good as he is. This class has also given me a new appriciation for how hard it is to actually design a website nowadays; not to mention, doing it all without tables!!!
